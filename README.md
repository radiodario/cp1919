Final version - It allows you to remix and play around with the stems from a track by @shirobon

All music is property of @shirobon and cannot be sold or reproduced without his consent. Ask him on twitter tho, he's pretty nice.

It's written in processing and uses the `maxim` audio library put together by the staff of the coursera course.

Thanks
